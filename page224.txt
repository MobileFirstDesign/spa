An adequate supply of vitamin D is necessary for good bone development. People who are low in vitamin D may have increased risk of hypertension, diabetes and some (colorectal, breast, prostate) cancers; autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, or rheumatoid arthritis may also have a vitamin D component</p> <p>The Dietary Reference Intakes on the Health Canada website recommends between 200 and 2000 IU/day. However, as a result of the recent studies on vitamin D status and health, nutritionists are starting to encourage intakes at the higher intake range. Vitamin D can build up to toxic levels in the body, so some caution is needed</p><p>Synthesis in the skin involves UVB radiation that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3. In the body, pre-vitamin D3 metabolised to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 25(OH)D3. The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D3 are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation. The pigmentaton in your skin also affects the amount of Viamin D you can produce; people with light skin are able to absorb more Vitamin D producing sunlight, and therefore can produce more natural Vitamin D.</p><p>People who live in the northern latitudes, where the hours of sunlight are reduced in the winter season, need to be aware that they may not be producing adequate Vitamin D via skin exposure. Also, people who follow customs that require the covering of the entire body need to be aware that that their natural production of Vitamin D will be compromised.</p><p>There is no risk of producing an overdose of vitamin D by exposure to sunlight because the skin's capacity to produce vitamin D is self-limiting - production stops when sufficient is produced.</p><p>Although some foods such as milk now contain added Vitamin D, there is mounting evidence that we require even higher levels to prevent a variety of diseases. In many cases, family doctors are recommending supplements to increase the intake of this important vitamin. But remember, Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin - it needs fat to be absorbed. Take your Vitamin D supplement with your meal.</p> <fieldset> <legend>Reference</legend> Dietary Reference Intakes Health Canada - https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/dietary-reference-intakes/tables/reference-values-vitamins-dietary-reference-intakes-tables-2005.html </fieldset>
