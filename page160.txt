As a result it has become obvious that the gut microflora is an essential component of the healthy animal. Not only is it involved in digestion of food, it is essential for the optimal resistance to disease. The first part of this book records the research that has been done on the factors affecting colonization of the gut and the effect that the flora has on the host animal. The second part discusses the way in which this basic knowledge affects the choice of organism being used as a probiotic. The evidence for the involvement of the gut microflora in the health and well-being of the animal is incontrovertible, but the development of probiotics has been largely empirical, failing to capitalize on the relevant research data. </p> <hr class="divider"> </div> </article> <article> <div class="book-info"> <h3>Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods</h3> <svg style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" width="160" height="240" viewBox="0 0 160 240" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path fill="hsla(176, 94%, 18%)" d="M0 0 L124 0 124 236 0 236 z"></path> <path fill="hsla(31, 93%, 55%)" d="M125 0 L154 0 154 236 125 236 z"></path> <path fill="white" d="M77 10 L134 65 74 121 20 63 z"></path> <path fill="hsla(31, 93%, 55%)" d="M72 10 L16 65 70 120 128 65 z"></path> <path fill="hsl(39, 60%, 58%)" d="M123 191 L45 190 36 182 14 199 35 218 49 204 123 204 z"></path> </svg> <p>by Edward R Farnworth</p> <p>Publisher -Taylor &amp; Francis,</p> <p>year - 2008 second edition</p> <p>ISBN - 0 849 31372 4</p> <p>Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods, Second Edition examines the health benefits of fermented foods as well as the processes and production techniques involved in manufacturing fermented food products. Maintaining the highest quality information and the easily accessible format of its predecessor, this edition includes new chapters on olives, tempeh, and the traditional fermented foods of China, Thailand, and India. It looks at the history of fermented foods and reveals the specific benefits of fermented milk, Kefir, yogurt, and cheese. Contributions cover fermented soy products, including Natto and Miso, as well as the fermentation of other vegetables such as Korean Kimchi and Doenjang and German sauerkraut. The book also explains the bioactivity and bioavailability of microorganisms and investigates the more recent practice of producing probiotic cultures to add to fermented foods for increased health benefit.</p> <hr class="divider"> </div> </article> <article> <div class="book-info"> <h3>LFRA Ingredients Handbook - Prebiotics and Probiotics</h3> <svg style="float: right; padding-left: 20px;" width="160" height="247" viewBox="0 0 160 260" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <rect width="156" height="247" stroke="black" stroke-width="1" fill="white"></rect> <rect x="0" y="0" width="156" height="60" fill="#121943"/></rect> <rect x="0" y="60" width="156" height="25" fill="#83302a"/></rect> </svg> <p style="margin-bottom:2rem">by Glenn R.
