Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and other nutrients. Vitamin A,D,E and K have been added.</blockquote> <p class="dropcap">For many people the way to cut down on fat in their diet is to start eating low fat foods. Early on food manufacturers found that when they removed the fat from many familiar foods, consumers were turned off by the taste and texture. Low fat foods had lost that smooth, melt in your mouth characteristic. It just didn&acute;t taste the same. Enter the chemists. They found that six, seven and even eight fatty acid molecules could be bonded to one sugar molecule to produce a synthetic fat. In natural fats and oils three fatty acids are bonded to a three carbon backbone called glycerol, to produce a triglyceride. The natural fats we eat are in the form of triglycerides. By combining sucrose (common sugar) with fatty acids found in natural fat sources (corn oil, soybean oil etc.) researchers were able to produce a new fat that had most of the properties of normal fat; foods containing the new synthetic fat looked and tasted the same as foods with natural fats. However, for dieters and health regulatory officials, there was one important difference.</p> <p>The synthetic fat was not digested as it passed through the gastrointestinal tract. Our bodies don&acute;t have the enzymes to break down the synthetic fat and so the fatty acids bonded to the sugar are not released, like they would be from a natural fat. The synthetic fat goes in one end and comes out the other. But that is exactly what people who were looking for low fat foods wanted. The synthetic fat wasn&acute;t digested, wasn&acute;t absorbed, passed out of the body and, therefore, added no calories to the diet. Great if you are on a diet! </p><p>Yes, fats are a source of calories in the diet. However, fat is also an essential nutrient. We all need some fat in our diet; one of the reasons is that without fat, the fat soluble vitamins are not absorbed as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamins A, D, E and K dissolve in fat and then pass through the intestinal wall. A synthetic fat that is not absorbed passes out of our body and so do the fat soluble vitamins. It is this dependance on fat to maintain adequate vitamin nutrition that has been the main reason for questioning the safety of having synthetic fats in the diet.</p><p>Recently Health Canada announced that they would not allow the artificial fat replacer Olestra to be included in foods to be sold in Canada. In 1996 permission was granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration to the Proctor and Gamble company to use Olestra in the preparation of salty or sharp-tasting snacks, such as potato chips, cheese puffs, and crackers.</p> <table class="center"> <caption><strong>Molecular Structure</strong></caption> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Synthetic Fat - Olestra</th> <th scope="col">Natural Fat - Triglyceride</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td class="center-img"><svg width="140" height="220" viewBox="0 0 140 220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path class="svg-clr" d="M75 46L81 60 69 80 46 80 34 56 45 40 59 40 M67 144L83 154 71 174 49 175 36 156 50 146 M104 183L84 177 81 38 M71 192L71 155 M47 192L47 161 M35 174 L35 134M45 99L45 57 M35 81L35 40M45 38L46 19M70 103L70 59"></path><text class="svg-text" x="45" y="14">FA</text> <text class="svg-text" x="18" y="36">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="57" y="58">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="43" y="114">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="32" y="129">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="45" y="158">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="107" y="189">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="69" y="207">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="63" y="43">O</text><text class="svg-text" x="51" y="146">O</text></svg> </td> <td class="center-img"> <svg width="140" height="220" viewBox="0 0 140 220" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path class="svg-clr" d="M53 80L20 80 20 142 53 142 M21 110L53 110 "></path><text class="svg-text" x="58" y="84">FA</text> <text class="svg-text" x="58" y="116">FA</text><text class="svg-text" x="58" y="148">FA</text></svg </td> </tr> </tbody> <tfoot> <tr><td class="tlink" scope="row" colspan="2">Note 1: FA = fatty acid<br />Note 2: Olestra is in fact a mixture of compounds that can contain 6,7, and 8 fatty acids on each sugar molecule<br />Note 3: Olestra is a patented product of the Proctor and Gamble company</td></tr> </tfoot> </table> <fieldset> <legend>External Link Index</legend> 1 - http://peromyscus.wsc.ma.edu/bioinf/molecules/olestra.htm" </fieldset>\
