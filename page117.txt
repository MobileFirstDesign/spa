<h2>Adding Anti-oxidants to the Diet</h2> <h3 class="publish-date">&#126; November 2000 No.117 &#126;</h3><blockquote>In 2012 USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) removed the USDA ORAC Database for selected Foods from the NDK website due to mounting evidence that the values indicating antioxidant capacity have no relevance to the effects of specific bioactive compounds, including polyphenols on human health.</blockquote> <p class="dropcap">Anti-oxidants have been labelled as the magic bullet for a large range of diseases including various types of cancers and cardiovascular disease. Antioxidants occur naturally in our bodies, or are obtained from certain foods; their primary function is to eliminate the damaging effects of free radicals that are in our bodies. The amount of antioxidants in our bodies together with those we get through our diet are usually enough to counteract the harmful effects of these free radicals. However, in cases where the body is overwhelmed, such as during times of stress, or when we are exposed to pollutants and toxins, this may not be enough.</p> <p>We should get as many sources of anti-oxidants in our diet as possible. One way would be to take supplements that contain vitamin A, vitamin E or vitamin C or selenium. These very potent antioxidants are commonly found in many supplements. For those who seek a more natural way, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables is always an option. It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 compounds in foods that act as antioxidants, so there is plenty of choice. In addition, when you consume fruits and vegetables you are getting much more than just the antioxidants that you are looking for.</p><p>Below is a list of fruits and vegetables and their anti-oxidation power as measured by a test called the Aoxygen radical absorbence capacity@ or ORAC. The higher the ORAC value the higher the anti-oxidant power of the food.</p><p>Regularly adding some of these sources of antioxidants to your diet would be a good idea.</p> <table class="center"> <caption><strong>ORAC units for fruit and vegetables</strong></caption> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col" colspan="2">FRUIT</th> <th scope="col" colspan="2">VEGETABLE</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><th scope="row"> Prunes:</th><td> 5,770</td><th> Kale:</th><td> 1,770</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Raisins:</th><td> 2,830</td><th> Spinach:</th><td> 1,260</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Blueberries:</th><td> 2,400</td><th> Brussels sprouts:</th><td> 980</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Blackberries:</th><td> 2,036</td><th> Alfafa sprouts:</th><td> 930</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Strawberries:</th><td> 1,540</td><th> Broccoli florets:</th><td> 890</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Raspberries:</th><td> 1,220</td><th> Beets:</th><td> 840</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Plums:</th><td> 949</td><th> Red bell pepper:</th><td> 710</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Oranges:</th><td> 750</td><th> Onion:</th><td> 450</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Red Grapes:</th><td> 739</td><th> Corn:</th><td> 400</td></tr> <tr><th scope="row"> Cherries:</th><td> 670</td><th> Eggplant:</th><td> 390</td></tr> </tbody> <tfoot> <tr><td class="tlink" scope="row" colspan="4">data expressed as ORAC units per 1200 g portion of food</td></tr> </tfoot> </table> <fieldset> <legend>Reference</legend> Food and Nutrition Research Briefs<br><em>ARS-USDA</em> 1999,<strong>April</strong><br>http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/np/fnrb/fnrb499.htm </fieldset>
