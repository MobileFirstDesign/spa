The visibility of this particular fatty acid has increased significantly because of the belief that we are not getting enough of this fatty acid in our diets, and the increasing evidence that omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful against certain diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases.</p> <p>Omega-3 has a good sound to it in advertizing and on labels. Cis,cis,cis-delta 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid or even linolenic acid just is too complicated or not as catchy to the average consumer. But it is cis,cis,cis-delta 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic or linolenic acid that is getting the most attention these days as the omega-3 fatty acid that we should be eating more. Together with linoleic acid, linolenic acid is considered a dietary essential fatty acid because the body can&#8217;t make it. We have to depend on our diet to supply us with enough. </p><p>Linolenic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has three double bonds, and it is related to other polyunsaturated fatty acids that have a double bond in the omega-3 position of their molecules. In the body, the members of the omega-3 family are connected by metabolic steps. </p><p>Until recently, even the text books couldn&#8217;t list a use in the body for the omega-3 fatty acids. It appeared that it might be involved in brain development and function, but the data using experimental animals was not consistent. The highest levels of linolenic acid are found in the various parts of the eye and yet animals fed diets almost devoid of linolenic acid over several generations failed to show any effects of vision.</p><p>Recent studies in which the protective effects of fish against certain types of heart disease have raised the profile of the omega -3 fatty acids. Fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids along with a variety of vegetable oils. But it is this very situation that is causing the health regulators so much concern. Studies are showing that omega-3 fatty acids can fight disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods we eat. If you are concerned about heart disease and you start to eat fish to increase your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, is that the same as downing a capsule of oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids?</p><p>As more studies find that omega-3 fatty acids are protective against certain types of heart disease, can the capsule seller make a health claim on the bottle label? And what about the fish monger? Product labeling is a very important issue facing the marketing of foods and food ingredients that are good for health.</p> <table class="center"> <caption>Linolenic Acid</caption> <tbody> <tr><td scope="row" class="center-img"> <svg width="300" height="300" viewBox="0 0 300 300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path class="svg-clr" d="M39 219L51 226 73 213 96 226 119 213 141 226 161 213 183 226 205 216 229 226 249 214 250 187 269 177 269 149 249 138 249 114 227 99 227 78 206 62 M227 220 L245 210 M263 174 L263 151 M49 228 L49 244 M54 226 L54 244 M227 223 L227 233 M249 213 L257 217 M269 174 L278 178 M269 149 L279 148 "></path><text x="21" y="216">HO</text> <text class="svg-text" x="48" y="253">O</text><text class="svg-text" x="223" y="244">H</text><text class="svg-text" x="259" y="224">H</text><text class="svg-text" x="281" y="187">H</text><text class="svg-text" x="281" y="148">H</text></svg </td></tr> </table> <fieldset> <legend>External Link Index</legend> 1 - https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ compound/linoleic_acid#section=3D-Conformer </fieldset>
